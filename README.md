  * ðŸ’¼ I'm looking for a 23-Week internship starting in September 2024
  * ðŸŒ± Currently working on game engines 
  * ðŸ’¡ Interested in Games Engines, Game Design, Game development, VR, and Software development
  * ðŸ“« you can reach me at mbozane@etu.uqac.ca or marius.bozane@utbm.fr


## My main projects:

### Pepper Engine
https://github.com/Suiram24/PepperEngine

This game engine has been started from scratch in an engine physics course, and as been improved past the initial objective.
The initial project was done in a group of 3. I made the architecture, project management and the debug/review of most of the code, and a bit of implementation.
Since then, I made a branche where I implemented Flecs to help me understand how a real ECS work (and not just EC-Framework like the one I made in the initial project).
I am now currently working on implementing my own ECS in the engine.

Things I made in the initial group project:
 * Software architecture of all the engine
 * Project management (division of tasks, deadlines...)
 * Project setup (CMake configuration of the project, management of externals libs)
 * Entity-Component framework implementation (everything that is in the EngineCore lib, and most of the components classes)
 * Implementaton of collision resolution
 * Code review of most of the code
 * Lot of debug in the math and physics parts

Things I made later:
 * Flecs Implementation
   
Things I am doing/planning to do in the next month:
 * Job system
 * Allocators
 * my own ECS implentation

### Life-VaiR
https://github.com/LifeVair/Life-VaiR

In this serious games in Virtual Reality, I was was working with another student under the supervision of a dev lead as part of a project course at UTBM. 
I made the implementation of one puzzle, including one gameplay mechanic.
This was my first Unreal Engine project, and my first completed VR prototype.

Other projects I have to describe :

* Gang de Croquette: a game made for the Ubisoft University Competition in a group of 8, that has been nominated 4 times. Pending steam release
* Elementalist Brush: A VR POC game, in a group of 3, where we implemented a symbol recognition algorithm from scratch and made it work inside an oculus Quest 2.
* Project HC: A little soulslike game made in a game conception course.
* Network : A short network course assignement, in a group of 8, where we replaced the Unreal Engine replication system by our own replication. I worked on the system that serialize the world state of the server and deserialize it in the client.
